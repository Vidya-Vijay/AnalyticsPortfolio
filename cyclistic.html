  <h1>Pedaling Toward Insights: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h1>
  <p>Google Analytics Capstone Project</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, I analyzed Cyclistic’s Q1 2020 bike-share data to uncover differences 
    between casual riders and members. Using SQL Server for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for visualization, 
    I identified key trends in trip volume, ride duration, and time-of-day patterns. 
    My findings informed targeted marketing strategies and operational improvements, with a focus on converting casual riders 
    into loyal members.

<section>
  <h2>Key Insights</h2>

    <li>Members account for 88.64% of rides (378K trips), and casual riders only 11.36% (48K trips).</li>
    <li>Member usage dominates each month, with January leading at 136K rides.</li>
    <li>Casual ridership is relatively low but shows growth from January (8K) to March (28K), hinting at seasonal patterns or warming weather.</li>
    <li>Casual riders take longer trips (20.3 min average) vs. members (10.5 min), suggesting leisure usage.</li>
    <li>Members peak midweek (commuting patterns), casual riders peak on weekends (recreational usage).</li>  
    <li>Start time analysis reveals two strong peaks for members (8 AM & 5 PM) and flat usage for casuals, with slight afternoon activity.</li>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  
    <p>1. Target casual riders with weekend leisure promotions and convert them into members.</p>
    <p>2. Increase bike availability in key stations during weekday peaks and weekend leisure times.</p>
    <p>3. Focus marketing efforts on stations with high casual riders activity.</p>
