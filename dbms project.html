  <h1>Chemical Production Plant Management System</h1>
  <p>A SQL-based database system for managing chemical production plant operations</p>
</header>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> COMP 230 – Databases and Database Management Systems <br>
  

<section>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved designing and implementing a relational database system to manage operations in a chemical production plant. 
    The system streamlined production batch scheduling, raw material inventory tracking, customer order processing, and payment management.
    Built to support roles like plant managers, QA, and inventory teams, this project showcased end-to-end DBMS skills.

  <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>MySQL Database</li>
    <li>phpMyAdmin for database interface</li>
    <li>SQL: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) </li>
    <li>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Normalization</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Normalized Schema Design:</strong> Created 10+ interrelated tables in 2NF with clear functional dependencies to reduce redundancy and ensure integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Entity Relationship Diagram:</strong> Mapped entities like Raw_Material, Supplier, Product, Order, Customer, and Payment using Chen’s notation.</li>
    <li><strong>Relational Mapping:</strong> Used bridge tables (Product_Material, Order_Details) to model M:N relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>DDL & Implementation: </strong>Built schema using MySQL and implemented all relationships with appropriate data types, constraints, and indexing for query efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>SQL Queries:</strong> Developed advanced queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries, and aggregation to generate reports on order status, raw material usage, and customer payments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results & Outcomes</h2>
  
    <li>Achieved a fully operational MySQL-backed system for inventory control and production monitoring.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated real-world application of relational modeling, normalization, SQL optimization, and database design principles.</li>
    <li>Received positive feedback for completeness, performance, and clarity of schema design.</li>  <br>
<p>Overall, this project strengthened my practical skills in database design, normalization, and SQL optimization, while giving me hands-on experience in managing data integrity, implementing relational logic, and confidently translating business requirements into efficient, data-driven solutions.
