  <h1>Reviving Restaurant Sales: A Data-Driven Approach Using Predictive Analytics and Business Insights</h1>
  <p>A predictive analytics project to support a local Thai restaurant's business turnaround</p>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> BUS 424 – Customer Intelligence<br>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   This was a team project aimed to support a family-owned Thai restaurant in Abbotsford that was facing declining sales and customer satisfaction.
  </p>

  <p>Using 300+ days of sales and review data, I contributed to data cleaning, regression modeling, and sentiment analysis. Through EDA, MLR, and NLP, we identified key trends like low weekday sales, strong holiday performance, and 
    a correlation between positive reviews and tips, and developed interactive dashboards for business insights and targeted campaigns.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> SQL, RapidMiner, Tableau, Power BI, Python
    <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modelling, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Data visualization, 
      Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis
      </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <p>Built an end-to-end analytics solution to diagnose and resolve performance issues at a local restaurant, integrating structured and unstructured data sources.</p>
   <li>Collected and cleaned 313 days of sales, weather, and calendar data using SQL and Excel</li>
   <li>Integrated 400+ Google reviews with sentiment scores using web scraping (Python) and merged with tipping data</li>
   <li>Created dynamic dashboards for weekly sales, tipping behavior, ratings, and sentiment</li>
   <li>Built a predictive regression model (RMSE: 276.99) in RapidMiner to estimate daily revenue using variables like day, temperature, and holidays</li> 
   <li>Used NLP to correlate customer sentiment with tipping behavior and visualized trends using word clouds and sentiment charts</li>

  <h2>Results & Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sales were lowest on Thursdays, highest on Sundays</li>
    <li>Warm temperatures and holidays increased revenue significantly</li>
    <li>Negative customer sentiment grew after staff changes and linked to lower tips</li>
    <li>Word clouds highlighted "delicious" and "friendly" in positives; "messed" and "disappointed" in negatives</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We recommended targeted weekday promotions, sentiment-based dashboards, 
	and basic automation for inventory and staff scheduling. We also proposed QR-based private feedback + discount system to recover customer trust
The goal was to improve service quality and customer retention while optimizing operations with minimal overhead.
</p>

<p>Overall, this project strengthened my skills in data storytelling, model validation, and translating business problems into analytical solutions, while also reinforcing the power of analytics in small business decision-making.
